To use this project, you will need one NAO roboter, one or two tablets with the naolympics app and a Bubble Level app
installed, one or two tripods, aluminium foil, scissors, some type of glue and optionally a tape measure.

If u use this application from your computer you need to change the robotIP at the top of the main.py. If you start it
directly at the nao, you need to provide the program the robotIp by writing "-i" and the IP, for example -i 10.30.4.13
at startup.

Now, start the robot. Let him open his hand manually or start the program and do the calibration till the robot opens
his hand automatically.
After that, you wrap the aluminium foil around the finger of the robot. The best way to do this is to first wrap some
foil around his fingertip by cutting in a small piece of aluminium foil from all sides, but keeping it as one piece.
Secondly, you wrap some aluminium foil around the rest of the finger and glue it all together. The more contact the
aluminium foil to the plastic finger has, the better the transport of energy will be and the touches will work more
reliable.
After you have done this you can start or continue the program.
Before every game you first need to start the naolympics app and choose if you want to play local on one tablet or
global on two tablets. While telling the nao which game you want to play choose it also on the tablet.
